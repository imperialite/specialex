Short Story: "Once upon a time there was a little boy called Percy. He loved to play with his toys and was always looking for something new to do. One day, Percy's parents took him to a chess tournament. Percy was fascinated by the chess pieces and the different ways they moved around the board. He was also very impressed by how skilled the players were! At one point, Percy's parents asked one of the players whether he would show Percy how to play chess. The player agreed, and he gave Percy a few tips and showed him how to move the pieces. Percy was a quick learner and soon got the hang of it. The next day, the player came back and asked Percy to play a game with him. Percy was so excited! He was really enjoying the game and tried hard to remember all the moves he had learned the day before. The match went on for a long time, but eventually Percy won! The player was surprised and impressed with Percy's brilliant play. He pointed to Percy and said, ""Now that's what I call a really good game!"" Percy was very proud of himself. That was the best day ever!"

But whoever did it has to put it back together again."" Jimmy was determined to find out who broke the window. He ran around the house asking his siblings and neighbours, but nobody knew. He eventually found the culprit - a tiny bird. It was trying to fly through the window and got stuck, breaking the window in the process. Jimmy felt sorry for the bird and helped it fly away.
