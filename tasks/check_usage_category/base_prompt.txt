Short Story: "Once upon a time, there was a king. He was a big and strong king who ruled over his kingdom. One day, he wanted to take a nice and long bath, so he filled up his big bathtub with warm water. He wanted to feel relaxed and so he soaked in the tub for a really long time. When he had finished soaking and stepped out of the bathtub, the king noticed that the water had spilled out of the tub and all over the floor. He felt guilty that he had made such a mess, so he quickly grabbed a cloth and began to clean it up. The king got so hot from cleaning up the mess that he decided to take another soak in the bathtub. He put a lot of bubbles in the water to make it nice and bubbly. He relaxed again and felt all the worries wash away. The king was so happy that he had been able to clean up the mess he had made and enjoy a nice soak. He dried off and wrapped himself up in a big towel. Then, the king went back to ruling his kingdom and enjoying his lovely baths."
