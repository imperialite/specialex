Short Story: "Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and run. Lily had a red hat that her mom gave her. She loved her hat very much. But then a big wind came and blew Lily's hat away. Lily ran after her hat, but it was too fast. She saw her hat fly over the fence and into the street. Lily was very sad and scared. ""Tom, help me! My hat is gone!"" she cried. Tom ran to Lily and hugged her. He saw a car stop near the fence. A nice lady got out of the car and picked up Lily's hat. She walked to the fence and gave Lily her hat back. ""Here you go, little girl. I saw your hat fly away. Are you okay?"" the lady asked. Lily smiled and took her hat. She put it on her head and said, ""Thank you, lady. You are very kind. I am okay, but my hat was hurt. It has a hole."" The lady looked at the hat and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Your hat was hurt by the car. But it still looks pretty. Maybe your mom can fix it for you."" Lily nodded and said, ""Yes, maybe. Mom is good at fixing things. Thank you again, lady. Bye-bye."" The lady waved and said, ""Bye-bye, little girl. And be careful with the wind."" Lily and Tom said bye-bye to the lady and went back to the park. They played some more, but they held their hats tight. They did not want to lose them again. They seemed happy and safe."
