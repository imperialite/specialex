She put it on her head and said, ""Thank you, lady. You are very kind. I am okay, but my hat was hurt. It has a hole."" The lady looked at the hat and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Your hat was hurt by the car. But it still looks pretty. Maybe your mom can fix it for you."" Lily nodded and said, ""Yes, maybe. Mom is good at fixing things. Thank you again, lady. Bye-bye."" The lady waved and said, ""Bye-bye, little girl. And be careful with the wind."" Lily and Tom said bye-bye to the lady and went back to the park.
